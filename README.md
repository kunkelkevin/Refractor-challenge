# Refractor-challenge1

The refractor challenge was a way to update a website to be more accessible and efficiently designed.  The visual layout of the website remained the same, but changes were made to the html and css.

In order to made the code follow accessibility standards, semantic HTML elements replaced several of the divs.  These included: header, footer, nav, article and section.  Comments were also added to differentiate the different sections.  

The link for search engine optimization did not work because an id was not given to that section, so that was added. The title was renamed with the company name, "Horiseon".

The images were all given alt descriptions.  The three picture ones were given a description of what I best interpreted them as, and the symbols for the benefits section were given blank descriptions since they were just for style and did not provide any meaning.

In the style sheet, several classes replicated the same code, so they were consolidated.  New generic classes were created to replace the specific classes that were duplicates.  Any other code that was a replication was simplified and combined.  The order of the code was moved as well to group each section with it's appropriate code.  Comments were added to designate the different areas the styles were affecting.

[The live webpage can be viewed here.](https://kunkelkevin.github.io/Refractor-challenge/) I had difficulty understanding Git at first and ended up deleting the repository to start over after I was finished refractoring the code.  Therefore, I only have one commit for my code.
